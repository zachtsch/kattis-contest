Set up your contest as you desire and then click create contest.  Currently 168 is the max hours a contest can last.  You'll end up at a url like this: https://open.kattis.com/contests/junk/edit (not an actual link).

This page will allow you to choose problems and also invite kattis users to the contest.  Run my script on that page to automatically invite users.  You can run it through devolper tools or some browers will let you put it in the url bar.  **javascript:** and then the code to run and then press enter to run it.
