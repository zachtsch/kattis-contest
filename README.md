# kattis-contest
Helpful .js script that invites a bunch of users to a Kattis contest

###Instructions
Go here: https://open.kattis.com/new-contest

Set up your contest as you desire and then click create contest.  Currently 168 is the max hours a contest can last.  You'll end up somewhere here: https://open.kattis.com/contests/junk/edit (not an actual link).

This page will allow you to choose problems and also invite kattis users to the contest.  Run my script on that page to automatically invite users.  You can run it through devolper tools or some browers will let you paste in the script and press enter to run.

Populate the users dictionary in the script with your desired names and accounts.
